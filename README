NAME
    Module::Install::Skip - Module::Install extension that allow skip files
    with regexp.

SYNOPSIS
      Makefile.PL
            use inc::Module::Install;
            ...
            # will skip *.in files from installation
            skip('\.in$');
            ...

METHODS
  skip
    Takes one argument - regexp. Returns nothing. Files that match regexp
    wouldn't be installed. Subsequent requests override previous so use
    complex regular expression instead.

NOTES
  preamble
    This extension doesn't cover drop-ins into Makefile that was done
    directly, for example with ExtUtils::MakeMaker->preamble call.

    For example: Module::Install::RTx use preamble call for all dirs except
    libs, you can filter lib files but not bin/sbin.

  libscan
    M::I::Skip uses libscan overriding. I didn't test with other
    Module::Install extensions which uses libscan too because I don't know
    no such extensions on CPAN yet.
